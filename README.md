## Inspiration
As busy STEM students, we often find that there is insufficient time to conduct our reseasrch in a subject matter as we have poor time management and our addiction to instant gratification apps such as TikTok makes our attention span SUPA SHORT. It does not help that the webpages we refer to are often lengthy in nature and provide too much information. Hence, it would be good if we can find a way to highlight and summarise key points on the webpage.

## What it does
This Chrome extension reads the content of the webpage and runs a Textrank AI algo to rank the sentences based on the relative importance and significance. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The program then highlights the top few sentences which shows the summary or key points of the webpage</span>.

## How we built it
Javascript and ReactJS with inspiration from previously implemented Textrank algorithms

## Challenges we ran into
NOBALDI in our group speak proper Javascript. ReactJS and node.js adds in another layer of complexity. 2/3 of our members still don't know how to use ReactJS. We also took SUPA long to decide on problem so we had limited time to code.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We slept 6 hours.
The chrome extension kinda works...

## What we learned
Javascript is a b****

## What's next for Chrome Summarizer and Highlighter
Further improvements to the Textrank AI algorithm.
Better implementation to the highlighting process.
Compatibility with ChatGPT and/or Google docs for easy transfer
